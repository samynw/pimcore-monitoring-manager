# Default jobs

There is only a limited set of default jobs.
The main goal of this bundle is to add application-specific jobs, based on your own project needs.

## Package Checker

This job will call the Symfony Security Checker, which will validate if any of your Composer packages has known vulnerabilities.
See [Syfmony Security website](https://security.symfony.com/).
## Coffee Maker

This job will always return the Teapot status code and has no practical use other than testing.
